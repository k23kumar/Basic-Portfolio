      <p>My name is Kelvin Kumar. I am 28 years old. I currenly work as a Production Assistant at the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

      <p>My favorite part of the job is creating exhibits and classroom materials. This requires creativity, skill and problem solving. I enjoy working with my hands and learning techniques and processes from the veteran members of our team.</p>

      <p>I realize the value of my work when I see kids engaging in the exhibits and materials I helped create. It's great to see that my work directly fosters science education to our future scientists.</p>
